Blink-swift is simple application for communication between iOS devices and Intel Edison. It is better to start with Intel Edison [simple application](https://github.com/snyuryev/Blink-edison) for Node.js. After uploading this application to your Intel Edison you will be able to control onboard led from your iOS device.
